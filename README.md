**How to Run:**

Requirements:
- Git
- Visual Studio (*Not* VS Code!) with the "Desktop development with C++" package installed

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to download and install the Flutter SDK, and follow the `flutter doctor` to ensure your environment has everything it needs.

Once everything is set, just open the project in VS Code or any editor, navigate to `main.dart` and run the file. Alternatively, run the command `flutter run` in CMD.

**AI Usage**
Chat GPT was used to generate test cases and mock files for shared, server, and app, though hand altered to actually work properly and test all resources.
Chat GPT used extensively to help debug and advise, too many instances to really track. However, it was not really used to generate actual implemented production level code, besides as an advisor and idea/algorithm assistant. 
Copilot used throughout as part of just general programming (I.E quick fill and auto fill, but not really text exchange.)
