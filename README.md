**How to Run:**

Requirements:
- Git
- Visual Studio (*Not* VS Code!) with the "Desktop development with C++" package installed

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to download and install the Flutter SDK, and follow the `flutter doctor` to ensure your environment has everything it needs.

Once everything is set, just open the project in VS Code or any editor, navigate to `main.dart` and run the file. Alternatively, run the command `flutter run` in CMD.
